# Beatport-Yearly-Chart-Compiler
Compiles a "Best of Year XXXX" from the bptoptracker archives.
The bptoptracker genre list has not been updated since some time in 2017, so some genres suchy as Afro-House are not obtainable.

The full year version of the code saves all available genres (including Top-100) for a particular year.

Incredibly simple to use, simply follow the prompts! 


Should there be a problem, or just something you want to say, do not hesitate to send me a message!

Regards,

Von Knudsen.
